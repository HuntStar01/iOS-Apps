# iOS-Apps
This repository features multiple iOS apps developed using Xcode. One app uses CallKit to initiate test calls, another enables real calling and contact management with the default dialer, and the last app is a music player built with SwiftUI. Each app showcases distinct iOS development skills and framework integrations.
